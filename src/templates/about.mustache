                            &emsp;&emsp;I aim, in my work, to lead viewers to question the relationships between color, volume, and time while exploring the possibilities of registration. Growing up as a digital native, I have forever been fascinated with the processes, the artifacts, and the peculiarities of analog mediums and how I can integrate them with modern technologies. In an increasingly software-driven art and design scene where CAD, dye sublimation, and Photoshop have all but replaced clay molds and cardboard prototypes, the hand methods of print media, and photographic forethought, I am forever searching for the bygone techniques of artisans to approach modern artistic problems from an otherwise overlooked perspective.<br><br>
