## MVP To Do:
* ~~add single pages for each individual project~~
* add full-resolution image on click on project pages
* ~~use slick native lazy loading~~
* google analytics

* ~~fix mobile version~~

* add hyperlinks between pages
* update all css/js links to use build files
* add mustache to the build pipeline
* header partial should have html head
* template out page title

## REMEMBER:
remove jQuery wrapper from template.js when finished with development


## Not MVP To Do:
* make a low-res to high-res image loader based on mouseover (// on mouseover, load hi-res image and next two images)
* deviceOrientation integration
* create new normalize function that uses exponential movement between values
* use .position() instead of autistic get functions
